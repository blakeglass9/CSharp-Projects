# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.

## Projects:
- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/blakeglass9/CarInsurance)
- [Blackjack](https://github.com/blakeglass9/TwentyOne/tree/main/TwentyOne)

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Blackjack/TwentyOne
This project is an MVC web application that simulates a simplified Blackjack game (also known as TwentyOne). Players can draw cards, calculate their totals, and compete against the dealer while adhering to the rules of Blackjack. The application uses a layered approach, separating game logic, UI rendering, and data handling to create a scalable and maintainable codebase. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented principles, Razor views, and MVC design to deliver a fully interactive gaming experience.
