# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.

## Projects:
- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/blakeglass9/CarInsurance)
- [Blackjack](https://github.com/blakeglass9/TwentyOne/tree/main/TwentyOne)

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Blackjack/TwentyOne
This project is an MVC web application that simulates a simplified Blackjack game (also known as TwentyOne). Players can draw cards, calculate their totals, and compete against the dealer while adhering to the rules of Blackjack. The application uses a layered approach, separating game logic, UI rendering, and data handling to create a scalable and maintainable codebase. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented principles, Razor views, and MVC design to deliver a fully interactive gaming experience.

### Azure DevOps Live Project
The Rental History Project involved creating a web application using C# and ASP.NET MVC to manage costume and prop rentals. We implemented features like:
Displaying Rental Items: Listed items with their statuses (e.g., "Pirate Costume") using color-coded badges for quick visual identification.
Ellipsis-Triggered Actions: Included dropdown menus for actions like "Edit," "Details," and "Delete," triggered by hovering over ellipsis icons.
Sorting and Filtering: Added controls for sorting rental history items.
Responsive UI Design: Styled the interface with a black background, white text, and hover effects to match the desired design.
